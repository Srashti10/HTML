    <!-- We must use controls keyword to enable controls in the video such as play, pause,download etc. -->
    <!-- using autoplay keyword it will play the video as we load the page -->
    <!-- muted keyword will mute the video -->
    <!-- If we give an image in the poster attribute then it will work as a thumbnail for the video. -->
    <audio src=""></audio>
    <!-- audio tag works same as video tag and attributes are also same in audio tags. -->
    <!-- preload attribute is used when we want browser to preload the audio. -->
     <!-- we can use different values in the preload attribute such as none,metadata,auto. 
     none - It is the default value. When it is used it means the browser should not preload video at all.
     metadata - It will preload only metadata of the audio such as duration, It is used if we want to show the duration of the
     audio before loading it.
     auto - It will fully preload the audio file in the browser before disturbing the other important tasks.
     The browser will try to load it in the background to make it ready when the user wants to play it. -->
