    <!-- Direction of the flex means, in which direction the align-items
    are laying, by default it is from left to right. But 
    we can change it from top to bottom, by using flex- 
    direction = coulmn. -->
    <!-- The direction in which items are laying are main axis
    and the other direction which is perpendicular to main 
    axis is cross axis. -->
    <!-- justify-content and align-items property works 
    according to main axis. If the flex direction is row
    then main axis is horizontal and if we do justify-content
    center or align-items center then it will make items
    center according to row. -->
